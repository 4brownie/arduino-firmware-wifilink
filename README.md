# WiFi Link - ESP8266 firmware for Arduino

This is a fork of Arduino.org WiFi Link firmware. The goal of this fork is make improvements for the Arduino Uno Wifi Developer Edition and provide [documentation for Uno WiFi Developer Edition](./UNOWIFI_DEV_ED.md).

The WiFi Link firmware is an ESP8266 arduino sketch developed by Arduino.org in Arduino IDE using Arduino esp8266 core. It is developed for the Arduino Star Otto, Arduino Primo and Uno WiFi and is compatible with Uno WiFi Developer Edition.

The corresponding Arduino library is [WiFi Link library](https://github.com/arduino-org/arduino-library-wifilink).
